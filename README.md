# Hedonic-Regression-Analysis-of-House-Prices
Built and optimized a hedonic regression model to predict house prices using transformed variables, interaction terms, and diagnostics like RESET and JB tests. Identified omitted variable bias in air conditioning effect. Achieved strong predictive performance (MAE = 0.128).

# House Prices Econometrics Case Study

This project was completed as part of the *Econometrics: Methods and Applications* MOOC by Erasmus University Rotterdam.  
It uses hedonic regression techniques to model and forecast house prices.

## Highlights
- Log-transformed price modeling (`log(sell)`)
- Dummy variable encoding and interaction terms
- Omitted variable bias diagnosis (air conditioning proxy)
- Model evaluation: RESET, JB test, MAE
- Tools: Google Sheets, R

## File Structure
- `CaseProject_HousePrices_AniketMimani.pdf`: Full report with diagnostics and analysis
- `data/`: Cleaned dataset used for modeling
- `code/`: R scripts or formulae used in Google Sheets

## Result
Achieved an MAE of 0.128 with strong fit and correct interpretation of model specification issues.
